# Release Strategy

`yeetr` releases run entirely in CI and are driven by **git tags** — the tag
*is* the version (via `hatch-vcs`; see `pyproject.toml`). A release never
commits to `main`, so it never fights branch protection, needs no tokens, and
requires no protection bypass. The GitHub repository is `RogerThomas/yeetr`,
the published PyPI distribution is `yeetr`, and the import package remains
`yeetr`.

## Overview

1. Run `task release` (or dispatch the **release** workflow from the Actions
   tab). `task release` only calls `gh workflow run release.yml` — it performs
   no local git operations.
2. The `release` workflow, on a GitHub runner:
   - runs the shared `checks` workflow (quality + tests + docs) as a gate — a
     broken commit cannot be released;
   - computes the next CalVer version (or uses the `version` input) and creates
     the matching tag on `main`'s current HEAD;
   - builds the package (the version is derived from that tag) and publishes to
     PyPI via Trusted Publishing (OIDC);
   - pushes the tag, creates the GitHub Release, and deploys the documentation.

To release a specific version instead of the auto-computed one:

```bash
task release -- 2026.5.21.post1
```

## Why tag-based

The version lives only in git tags, so there is no version field to bump and
no commit to push to `main`. That removes the entire class of problems around
pushing to a protected branch from CI — no PAT, no GitHub App, no protection
bypass. `main` stays fully protected; the release only ever pushes a tag, and
tags are not branch-protected.

## Quality gate

`checks.yml` is a reusable workflow (`workflow_call`) holding the quality,
test, and docs jobs. Both `main.yml` (on every push/PR) and `release.yml` (as
a release gate) call it, so the checks that must pass before a release are the
exact same definition that runs on PRs — no duplicated, driftable copy.

## Publishing to PyPI (Trusted Publishing / OIDC)

There is no PyPI API token to store or rotate. PyPI is configured to trust the
`release` workflow directly:

- **PyPI Trusted Publisher** — configured on the `yeetr` project with owner
  `RogerThomas`, repository `yeetr`, workflow **`release.yml`**, and environment
  `pypi`.
- **GitHub environment** — an environment named `pypi` gates the publish job.

At publish time the workflow requests a short-lived OIDC token
(`id-token: write`), exchanges it for a temporary PyPI upload token, and
publishes. Nothing long-lived is stored.

## Workflow split

- `checks.yml` — reusable quality/tests/docs checks.
- `main.yml` — calls `checks.yml` on every push and PR.
- `release.yml` (`workflow_dispatch`) — gate on `checks.yml`, then tag, publish, deploy.

## Operational requirements

- A PyPI Trusted Publisher and a GitHub `pypi` environment must be configured
  (see above).
- `main`'s required status checks must reference the reusable-workflow job names
  (e.g. `checks / quality`, `checks / tests-and-type-check (3.13)`), not the old
  bare `quality`, or PR merges will block on a check that never reports.

## Expected release path

- `task release`
- wait for the `release` workflow to gate, tag, publish to PyPI, and deploy docs
